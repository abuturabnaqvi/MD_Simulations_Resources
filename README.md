### Tools and Programs 
1. [GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations (GROMACS)](https://www.gromacs.org/)\
   GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles and is a community-driven project.
2. [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/)\
   NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems.
3. [YASARA](https://www.yasara.org/index.html)\
   YASARA is a molecular-graphics, -modeling and -simulation program for Windows, Linux, MacOS and Android.
4. [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0)\
   LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code with a focus on materials modeling. It's an acronym for Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator.
